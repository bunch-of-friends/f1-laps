# f1-laps

Eventually a companion app to Codemaster F1 games, which uses the game telemetry data to keep track of best lap times across the game (and eventually more!).

## Disclaimer

I am by far not a Rust expert. While the project is in an early stage, the Rust code might not be ideal, but it will improve over time.

## Structure

The core library is written in Rust. There are (will be) bridges to other languages (Java, ObjectiveC, C#, JavaScript), so that applications displaying the data can be built across multiple platforms.
